# Git Notes

## "Normal" Git

To get Git to pay attention to your changes:

`git add [filename]`

To commit your changes.

`git commit -m "change commit message"`

To push changes in the master branch to Github.

`git push`

## Branching

To create a branch:

`git branch [branchname]`

To change to that branch.

`git checkout [branchname]`

To push changes of a branch.

`git push origin [branchname]`

## Pull Requests

Once someone pushes a branch, they can create pull requests to signal to people that their code is ready.
